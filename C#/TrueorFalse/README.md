# True or False?

Use C# arrays and loops to create a true or false quiz.

You’re taking an interactive quiz written in C#. Everything is going fine until you respond to this question:

This application wasn’t checking your input. When you used an unexpected format, it couldn’t ask the question again and marked your answer as wrong. (By botanical definition, eggplants really are berries!).

In this project, you’ll build a C# program that presents a quiz the right way: using arrays and loops, it will check the format of user input and repeat the question if the format is incorrect. After the quiz is complete, it will check the user’s responses against the correct answers and present a score.
